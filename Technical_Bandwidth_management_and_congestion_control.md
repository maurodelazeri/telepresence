In this current beta version we only focus on video bandwidth.

The upload and download video bandwidth settings have to be defined using the configuration file as explained [here](Configuration_Video#Bandwidth_and_congestion_control.md). The maximum download bandwidth is signaled to the remote endpoints using the SDP (b=AS:X attribute as per RFC [3556](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3556)) and **RTCP-REMB** packets (as per [draft-alvestrand-rmcat-remb-02](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-alvestrand-rmcat-remb-02)). In this beta version, **RTCP-TMMBN** ([RFC 5104](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5104)) packets are deserialized but not processed by the system.

The congestion control manager could be enabled using the configuration file as explained [here](Configuration_Video#Bandwidth_and_congestion_control.md). In this beta version, [draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-congestion-03](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-congestion-03) is not fully implemented yet and weâ€™re using our own algorithms to compute the bandwidth usage. The computed maximum bandwidth (periodically) when the congestion control is enabled will never be higher than the maximum allowed values defined in your configuration file (this is kind of safe guard).
